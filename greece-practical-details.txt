Tuesday, July 31-Saturday, August 4
Kastraki
* Camping Vrachos (13EUR, 5 days; got charged for Saturday)
* 07/31: Last monastery (except Stephanos), then to Kalambaka 
   during siesta time, but everything was closed; took a nap, then
   explored Anbaria bricked caves and the viewpoint from Marmaro plateau 
   above Kastraki.
* 08/01: Tried to find routes at Kleine Helige (ascended quite a bit
   but couldn't find way up) and Sourloti-Kind. Saw the Spindel. Got lost
   in woods trying to find the Wal. Only found an impassable 
   rock face, not a passage.
   Carried all climbing crap. After siesta (without crap), consulted
   Vangelis and examined Holy Spirit and the Traumpheiler route.
   Saw old church in Kastraki. 
* 08/02: climbing with Vangelis Batsios 
   (route next to Nixenauge, 150m, 4 pitches), 100+20EUR/2pp
  In evening, climbed part of a pitch at Doupiani.
* 08/03: climbing at Doupiani again.
  Inadvertently climbed 25m on Historiche Meile (VII+) with some rests
  and a fall. Rappelled down on a stick of metal in the cave.
  Then met Jorgos and climbed 1 pitch of Ostria (much easier).
  In the evening, climbed near Kalambaka (Kleftogeorgios-Nordgipfel), 1 pitch,
  40m (20m rappel). Jorgos gave us a ride back to Kastraki while we were 
  walking along road.
* 08/04: climbing at Doupiani.
  First did one pitch of something near Ostria. Then did 2 pitches on a
  quite well-bolted new unlisted route (5.8 or 5.9 perhaps). Set up a toprope
  on that route. Reached the top of Doupiani there.
  Left in the evening before the rain.

  on the phone to arrange accomodation, although the room keys were just hanging
  next to the door.

Monday, August 6:
Travel to Ano Mousounitsa, hiking to refuge
* Took taxi from Lidhoriki to Ano Mousounitsa (30EUR) - had to go to
  Plateia and wait for a taxi. I think the Kallipolis owner said he'd
  call a taxi, but we bailed on that after 45 minutes. Taxis were really
  busy and we had to wait an hour for a taxi to appear.
* Ate at Ano Mousounitsa taberna in corner (didn't catch name) for 4EUR.
  Left bags there. Hiked up to 2nd refuge and set up tent there.
  The wide grassy meadow, Meghas Kambos, after the couloir, 
  would have been much better (flatter), but it is another hour away. 
  Hiking time: 1510-1900; book time 2h45.

Tuesday, August 7:
* Hiked up to Kourakas summit (2495m, Ano Mousounitsa elev 1000m).
  Total distance: 19km.

* Started at 1030, arrived at summit at 1230. (Posted time: 1h45).
* Left summit at 1300, returned to refuge at 1430, back at village at 1700.
* Ate at same taberna again.
* Taxi back to Lidhoriki (25EUR), stayed at Kallipolis (50EUR).

  Delphi, Itea (seaside resort), Arahova (ski town - only time I saw
  gear in Greece) - 18.90EUR
* Took 024 from bus terminal to somewhere ~20min from Syntagma.
  Couldn't figure out where to get tickets, hopped off the bus before
  inspector dude got on (the other bus).
* Stayed at the Hotel Arethusa (90EUR), on Othonos near Stadiou.
  Completely reasonable.
