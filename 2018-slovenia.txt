Slovenia impressions:
like Switzerland (alpine culture, is an even smaller country), but not obnoxiously rich
accommodations very clean and tastefully-appointed
automation less than in Switzerland: buy train tickets from a person, no McDonald's ordering machines, parking attendants
credit card sometimes chip + signature (?!)
food can be Balkan but isn't always
crags are severely sandbagged: hardcore country!
no kleenex boxes
recycling

accommodations reviews:

Oct 1: Maribor Ibis Styles
decent breakfast (2 steps up from standard Continental breakfast)
room was fine, a bit better than generic

Oct 2-3: Andrea's Rooms in Bled
Friendly host, great place, had kitchen with e.g. oil
convenient to the town

Oct 4-5: Katja's Apartments in Bohinj
lent us some pretty nice bikes
otherwise would not be so convenient to stuff, but as it was, fine for climbing at Ribcek Laz and walkable to Mostnica Korita
also close to the alpine cheese museum
suite-style with living room, kitchen, in addition to dining room/bedroom
lots of sawing going on (construction next door)

Oct 6: Kamnik with new airbnb host born in Hamilton (we were 6th guest)
former office space
offered us tasty soup on arrival
good decor

Oct 7: Hotel Jama
ok, a bit generic
but nice fancy hotel, what you would expect from 4*
recently renovated
service standard was high
no spa?

Oct 8: apartment Vrd ... near Krizna
another superb place, two apartments
farm animals nearby
little village, not much beside one gostnina and church
