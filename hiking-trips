January 13: hiked up Carrigain with Dmitriy Rogozhnikov (in lieu of Winter School participants).  distance: 14mi, 3800ft; start 9:30 finish 16:25.  Top in cloud.  Is the Signal Ridge skiiable?
January 14: Tecumseh again, with Drew Friedman, Radu Raduta, Dave Wentzlaff, Eyal Levin, Nicholas Edelmann, and Jasmine Sandhu.
April 6: Attempted to hike Moriah with MP, but missed the Carter-Moriah trailhead (must walk on street) and bushwhacked. Hit Mt. Surprise.
April 29: Another try at Moriah with MP and Dave. Used snowshoes. Got off trail again, this time above Surprise. Should have used snowshoes earlier. Started at noon, quit at 5:34, back to car at 9:30.
May 19-21: East Coast Trail with MP: Spout Path (11 hrs for 22km), Spurwick Island Path (2 days, ~5 hours each day for 16km total).
June 3: Finally climbed Moriah with Dave. Left Montreal at 7:30, arrived at trailhead at 11:00, started hiking at 11:30, summitted at 1:50, lunch till 2:20, reached trailhead at 4:00. Cloudy but no rain. Extremely slippery rock slabs. No trouble finding trail today. Found that last bailout point was ~3700ft, 30 minutes from summit. Used radios. On way back, ate at kickass Italian restaurant in Littleton. Book time 6:15, our time 5:30 (slow descent due to slipperiness; started ascent really fast.)
June 7: Climbed at QQ (Dave, Roger, MP)
June 23: Mt. d'$, transition moulinette course
June 24: climbing at Rigaud (MP, Roger)
June 25: hiked up South, Middle and North Carters with Roger. Left Montreal at 6:30, starting hiking at 11:10, finished hiking at 16:50, plus 1mi on Rt. 16 (20 minutes). Weather was passive-aggresively dark and splattery at start, then cleared up and was partly cloudy (high of 22 in woods, 29 in sun). Book time 7:10. Reasonable views, about 1 hour of bouldery terrain throughout. Forgot map.
July 7: hiked up Garfield, Galehead, South Twin, Zealand with Dave. Started at 9:15, finished at 7:00 (18mi). Weather was okay in the morning, showers in the afternoon, cleared up after we stopped hiking. Reached Galehead Hut at 1:15, back to hut at 1:45.
July 8: Cabot, Waumbek, Weeks, N. Terrace, Starr King with Dave Wentzlaff. Rainy morning (much shivering), got nice in the afternoon. Much elevation in Weeks. 20.1mi Started at 8:45, finished at 7:30.
July 21: canyoning at Little Santa Anita with Brian Demsky. Reached Sierra Madre Dam (and associated barbed wire fence). Rope management seemed to take most of the time. Water level unusually low; most deep pools weren't (except 1; hard to swim when on rappel rope!). Did not use any of our quicklinks, but changed webbings.
July 22: mountain biking at El Moro Canyon (rental $35/day from Laguna Beach Cyclery). Dusty inclines can be hard to accelerate on.
August 11-12: sailing on Lake Champlain with MP's mom. Wind to 18 kts on Sunday, got 6.8 kts of boat speed.
August 18-19: climbing at Montagne d'Argent with MP
August 26: hiking at Camden Hills State Park with Alex Ghitza. Tried to find climbing routes but failed; they are apparently near Maiden Cliff trailhead, not near the cliff. Hiked Maiden Cliff trail (2mi) and Mt. Megunticook to Ridge Trail (~4mi). 1000' elev gain, 4.5hrs.
August 27: hiked up Mount Abraham (ME) with Alex Ghitza. 8.25mi, 3050'. Started at 11:45, summit at 2:45, left summit at 3:30, car at 5:35 (10 minutes after trailhead). Spectacular weather (clear, 20C) and views. Trail has some scree at top but stable; short bouldery parts after cabin and at top. Encountered church group of ~12 from New Jersey and also a peakbagger working on NE 4ks. Summit reminiscent of Moosilauke; probably skiiable. Fairly steep after cabin (1.2mi, 2000'). On drive back, uncommon view of full moon low above horizon.
September 8: climbing at Mt d'$ with MP.
September 15, 2007: Marston Trail -> N. Brother spur -> Mt. Coe trail -> S. Brother spur -> Mt. Coe -> Marston, with Alex Ghitza.  11mi, 7.5hr. Mostly insides of clouds again, except briefly at S. Brother and a bit at the end. Trail is almost completely free of boulders except at N. Brother summit. Slide on Coe treacherous in the rain as promised in guidebook. (For a long time we were like, hey, this isn't so bad. Until the slab.) Well, it would be fun in the non-rain. "It's not just rocks around that can kill you, it's also you moving on rocks."
September 16: Katahdin! with Alex Ghitza. 11mi, start 06:25, finish 16:50. up on Helon Taylor trail to Pamola Peak, hitting Chimney Peak, through the Knife Edge (Alex was sketched out here in part due to the downclimbing and in part due to the frost); up to Baxter Peak, then down Saddle Trail to Northwest Basin trail to Hamlin Peak (completely uncrowded, unlike Baxter Peak; hit two other people), then down Hamlin Ridge (encountered one hiker) to N Basin and through to Roaring Brook and down the Chimney Pond trail. Generally bouldery (except Saddle Trail). Spectacular views; blue blue sky. Excellent day for hiking (unlike Saturday).
October 13: Moosilauke with MP, Winnie Ye, Elena Obukhove, Paul. Hiked up Gorge Brook and down Glencliff->Carriage Road. 7.2mi, start 10:00, finish 15:30.
December 19: hiked up to Hermit Lake shelter. Started at 2:30pm and arrived at 4:10pm. Skiied down and arrived at 5:00pm. Terrible technique due to a combination of factors: no light, XC ski poles only, heavy pack. Skinning works quite well up Tuckerman's Ravine trail to the hut.

2008
February 24: Johnston Canyon and Ink Pots hike at Banff. 11.6km, 700' gain, kind of like a snowy sidewalk. Walking seems faster than skinning. Sort of fast on the way down, with a narrow trail, so snowplowing seemed like the best way to go; not many turns earned. Started at 6:57. Summit at 8:57. Ink pots at 9:25, stayed till 9:40. Re-summit at 10:01. Back at 10:29.
April 27: Mt. Washington via Winter Lion's Head trail with MP. 20kg pack for me: serious cardio workout on final 0.4mi to summit (which took 30 minutes); no pack for MP. Yaktrax would have helped for MP, due to backsliding in snow on ascent. 8mi, 4250ft' gain. 4:30 to ascent, 3:50 to descend. Bootpack was unmelted, snow was otherwise relatively shallow. No snow from about 500' below Lion's Head to summit. Started at 9:30 (stayed at Joe Dodge Lodge night before), lunch at 2pm, down at 3:00pm, back at 6:55pm. Self-arrest practice, glissading. Crampons not required. MP had trouble descending boulders on top of Mt. Washington. Some rather technical bouldering on Winter Lion's Head.
June 1: Killington Peak with Dave and MP. 10.3mi, 2650'. 6:45: left Waltham (dom and ruth's wedding) at 8:30, got to trailhead at 12:15 (a few stops along the way, including Bridgewater Corners general store), finished at 19:00, ate supper in Bentley's Restaurant. Route: Bucklin Trail to Killington Spur to LT/AT to Pico Spur to Sherburne Trail. GMC lodges are quite different from AMC huts: similar to Cabot cabin (but larger). Partly sunny; only a few drops of rain. Views would be great on a nice day. The LT/AT between Killington and Pico is long and flat; all of the elevation gain is on Bucklin Trail (and Pico spur). Vermont trails are much less bouldery than NH trails.
June 8: Mt. Mansfield (Chin) with MP. 6.3mi, 2700'. 5:00. Up Sunset Ridge trail and down Laura Cowles trail. Weather reports predicted some chance of T-showers and 40% POP. Fortunately, only a few drops fell on us while hiking. The weather, however, was hot as promised (30C). Start at 1:00, summit at 3:50, back at 6:00. Treeline on Sunset Ridge at 3200'. Laura Cowles was .4mi shorter for descent, but slippery, wet, rocky and viewless; I think Sunset Ridge is a better bet. Left summit after 20 minutes after about 6 types of bugs landed on MP in a lull in the wind.
June 15: Mt. Abraham (VT) with MP. 5.8mi, 2500'. 4:30. Battell Trail. Weather was great (threatened thundershowers, but actually mostly sunny and 25C). Trail not bouldery or flat at all; great 360-degree views at summit. Limited scrambling near summit. Tried to go to Camel's Hump afterwards, but got lost. About 12 dogs on the trail (including 4 at once: 2 groups of 2 dogs).
June 24: Mt. Ellen and Camel's Hump with MP. Ellen via Jerusalem Trail: 8.4mi, 2580', 6:15. Camel's Hump via Burrows Trail: 4.8mi, 2300', 4:15. Hiked Ellen with weight (MP: 1gal+2L+pack weight, me: 1gal+2x5L+pack weight) for training purposes. Walked into a cloud atop Ellen, with wind. Summit is viewless, but ski trail just before summit would have views. MP was traumatised by guy without clothes (changing?) in liftee hut. Did not find Glen Ellen hut turnoff, but didn't look too hard. Did not find good country stores. Camel's Hump: about 30min drive away from Ellen. Started at 17:35, it got very dark at 21:00, arrived at car at 21:54. Summit is rocky and above-treeline; unfortunately no views due to clouds.
July 1: bike to Elora, 30km each way
July 5-6: bike to Mississauga and back, 108km each way (due to incompetence at routefinding in Cambridge on the way back; should be doable in 80km). Route should be Brittania to Tremaine to Derry to Milborough to Conc 10 E to Hwy 6 to Hwy 97 to Main St to King St. Time ~4hrs (4h20 elapsed going). Average running speed going was 27km/h, returning was 29km/h for first two hours. Max speed 57km/h.
*** rainier trip ***
August 9: Saddleback and the Horn, with Dave. Up the AT to Saddleback and the Horn. Extremely muddy trail, probably the worst all weekend. We started late---1:20pm---and ended at twilight, 8:10pm. In retrospect, staying the night in Farmington, ME would have gotten us closer to the trailhead; as it was, driving to the trailhead (near Madrid, ME) took 2 hours from Auburn. 14.8mi, 3100'. Lots of above-treeline exposure on this hike, as well as a nontrivial drop between Saddleback and the Horn. 
August 10: South Crocker, Crocker and Redington with Dave. Caribou Valley Road (gnarly 4mi drive) to the AT crossing, then northbound to South Crocker, on to Crocker Mountain, back to South Crocker, then "bushwhack" to Redington and out on Caribou Valley Road (2mi road walk). The bushwhack is dead easy to navigate; it is just a narrow trail. We thought about going from Redington directly to Spaulding, but that bushwhack looked impossible. 10mi, 2800'.
August 10: Sugarloaf and Spaulding with Dave. Down the AT from Caribou Valley Road, spur to Sugarloaf (weird antennae), on to Spaulding (long ridge traverse) and back. Some rain. Got back after dark. 10mi, 2650'. 
August 11: Bigelow, Avery and West Peaks with Dave.  Brook Pond Road to trailhead for Fire Warden's Trail. Nontrivial water crossing. Hiked up to the AT, then hit West Peak and back to Avery Peak. Back down Fire Warden's trail. 10.6mi, 3100'. Last part of Fire Warden's Trail is steep. Trail not generally too muddy (but runs in a stream at times.) Only a short downpour of rain, then it cleared up.
October 13: Old Speck with MP. via AT. 7.8mi, 2664', 5:08. Instead of going climbing on Thanksgiving Monday, MP and I hike Old Speck, which is my last New England 4000-footer. The weather was better than I anticipated, but perhaps not great for climbing anyway---a bit damp. The weekend would have been good for climbing, but I was fighting the Quebec Open. 
December 6: Mount Baden-Powell with Brian (who bailed). 8.0mi, 2800', 4:00. Vincent Gap to summit and back. Trail was icy and skipping the switchbacks worked better, until I lost the trail and went down the gully. Yaktraxs would have helped.
December 7: Part of Piedras Pintadas Interpretive Trail with David Wentzlaff and Brian Demsky.
December 24: Giant Mountain (no summit), NY. ~6mi, 3000'. Due to a late start and going to Lake Placid (which is not the trailhead), we didn't manage to get to the summit before our turnaround time. Crampons helped. Started at 11:30, returned to car at 18:00. Had an extra trip up to retrieve a dropped snowshoe. Ran into a family of 8.

January 24: Welch-Dickey loop co-led with Mike Oltmans, participants Johanna Bernstein, Dan Barron, Aleem Siddiqui, Kristi Preston, Marek Olszewski, natalia Borecka. 4.4mi, 1800'. Not as spectacular as Adams but still quite good. A bit of bushwhacking provided entertainment and an example of what not to do. Many parties appeared between when we left and when we came back.
